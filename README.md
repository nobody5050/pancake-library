Pancake library was created to enable fast 2D pixel games creation to people with low and high developer knowledge. It lets you create a game in a bout 10 minutes or even less! Everything was made to be an easy expierience.

NOTE:

Pancake library works only in LÖVE (https://love2d.org/). It has been tested on LÖVE 11.3!

Pancake library also uses smallfolk (https://github.com/gvx/Smallfolk) for saving data in files!
